/*
Q4. Create a JavaScript program that takes a regex pattern and a string as input. Write a function that not
only checks if there is a match but also extracts specific parts of the matched text using groups. Test the
function with patterns that include groups to capture different parts of a date (e.g., day, month, and year)
from a given string.
