/*
Q5. You are building a shipping application. Write a program that takes the type of package ("standard",
"express", or "overnight") and uses a switch statement to calculate and print the estimated delivery time
based on the package type. For example, "standard" might take 3-5 days, "express" 1-2 days, and
"overnight" would be delivered the next day.
